<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
<p>I enjoyed reading the results of these tests. I'm very curious how answering some questions can create such an in depth analysis of my personality!</p>
<p>As I completed each of these personality tests, I noticed I seemed to be getting results that seemed pretty consistent with each other. My results showed that I was someone who looked out for other people and ensured that they were happy and comfortable, often putting their needs ahead of my own</p>
<p>These results, more or less, showed me what I already new. As the oldest child, I took it as my responsibity to make sure my younger siblings were happy and safe. I believe that this has been something I've carried throughout my life to the people around me.</p>
<p>The links to each test result and my own analysis are below! I hope you have as much fun reading them as I did!</p>
