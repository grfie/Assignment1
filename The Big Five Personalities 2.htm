<h1>The Big Five Personality Test</h1>
<p>The results of this test didn’t shock me a great deal. My highest percentage was 75% (Agreeableness). This describes my tendency to put other people’s needs ahead of my own and to cooperate rather than compete with others.</p>
<p>This goes hand in hand with my Myers-Briggs results. I’m more willing to make sure other people are ok rather than start a conflict. This can work well within a team to ensure peace is maintained; however, it may mean that I struggle to put forward my own opinion as I would prefer everyone to be happy.</p>
<p>The results of this test shows me that I may need to work with people who are also agreeable and who I can work with and be open with, without fear of argument or judgement. I should also ensure that I do learn to say my part when I need to, especially if it is for the benefit of the team.</p>
