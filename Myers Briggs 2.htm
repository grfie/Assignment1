<h1>Myers-Briggs Test</h1>
<p>According to this test, I am an ISFJ-T.</p>
<p>Reading the results of this test was quite interesting. I consider this to be a relatively accurate depiction of my personality. As the oldest of eight kids, I was always their defender, and I always made sure that they were ok. I agree with the results, in that I’m naturally social but I’m actually an introvert, and that I tend to remember details about people rather than facts and figures.</p>
<p>I believe this shows I would be the “mum” of the team, always checking in on people making sure they are ok and handling the work-load. I would also be meticulous and a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to the final product.</p>
<p>When it comes to choosing team members, I will need to ensure that I choose people that are willing to put in and do the work with me. According to this test (and personal experience) I’m a bit of a pushover, and have a hard time saying no to a bigger workload. I will need to ensure that my team members are perfectionists like I am, and willing to do their share of the work.</p>
