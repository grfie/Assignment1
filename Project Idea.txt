<h1>Project Idea</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>What if there was a way you could keep track of your spending with minimal effort? My project idea is a budgeting app for lazy people. An app where you only need to spend 5-10 minutes setting up where you want your money to go, and the app does the rest.</p>
<p>I’ve tried many budgeting apps, and my biggest issue was just setting it up and then forgetting about it. I want this app to send out notifications, or text messages to allow the user to keep track of their spending without having to actually go into the app.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>How many people have a budget and actually stick to it? According to ME Bank’s Household Financial Comfort Report in 2017, around half of Australian’s have no cash left over by the end of every month! Can you imagine that kind of stress? Maybe you’re living out that kind of stress right now?</p> 
<p>I want this app to be designed for people who have very little time in their lives to organise their finances, or just don’t know how to budget, or are even just too lazy to make a budget! I want this app to be a way for the user to set up their budget and never have to look at it again.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This app will be a free mobile app, available for all types of phones. After the user links their bank accounts to the app, the app will be able to automatically track the users spending and create monthly graphs outlining their spending and where it is all going.</p>
<p>But what will set this apart from the many other budgeting apps? It will send out a notification when you spend money from an allocated budget. The notification will outline how much you have left in the budget for the week/ fortnight/ month, thus allowing the user to make a mental note and watch their spending for that specific budget.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through this step by step:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user downloads the app onto their mobile phone and links their bank account.</li>
<li>The user then allocates their weekly/ fortnightly/ monthly income to separate budgets e.g groceries, petrol, food, shopping etc.</li>
<li>The user goes about their week, and as they spend money from the allocated budgets, they will be sent a notification. If, for example, the user allocated $50 in their food budget for the week, and they spend $30 at a restaurant, the app will send a notification along the lines of “You have spent $30 from your “Food” budget. You have $20 remaining till the end of the week”.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the notifications are the biggest part of the app, there are other features that it will have.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the app will have to be linked to the user’s bank account in order to track their spending and the type of spending they are doing. If the user is interested, they can use the app to look at where they are spending their money each week and adjust their budget accordingly. Taking this data, the app can create a monthly graph outlining in a simple, user friendly way, their spending of the past month.</p>
<p>Another feature of this app is setting goals. Money is not just about spending. In fact, there is a lot that we can do with our money if we only put a bit of effort and research. One of the things I find lacking in my own personal budget, is a goal!</p>
<p>This app will allow the user to enter a goal and assist them in reaching it within a specified timeframe. For example, if my goal were to save $5,000 by the end of the year. I would need to save around $185 per week for the rest of this year. The app could send a notification saying “Remember to put away savings for your Goal this week!”, or perhaps if I went over budget a certain week, it could adjust the weekly savings per week to continue to suit the end of year goal.</p>
<p>While I have a number of ideas for this app, I want the main focus to be on the notifications. Sending a notification to alert the user of how much money is left in an allocated budget, may at the very least, increase the user’s awareness of their spending.</p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>If I’m being 100% honest, I wouldn’t have the first idea of what sore of tools and technologies would be required to build an app such as this!</p>
<p>I believe one of the biggest hesitations people will have with an app like this, is security. After partaking in quite a bit of research, I learnt that a backend server is an important part of a mobile app. The backend of a system or an app includes the cybersecurity and data backups if the app. This is where the programming language will be stored, such as PHP or Python. Using software such as Firebase will provide tools to allow for tracking analytics and fixing crashes in the app.</p>

<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>There will be a considerable number of skills required to develop this app. Staring with the software that will need to be written. Unfortunately, as my experience is very minimal when it comes to writing software, it would take a bit more practice and training for me to learn how to do this. Fortunately, there are many places where I can learn the programming skills to start developing this app. I can even use GitHub to study what other developers have done and learn a some of the reasons for their decisions.</p>
<p>I will need to ensure the app is secure, especially as it will be dealing with bank accounts. This can be done through writing secure code and encrypting the data that is exchanged in the app.</p>
<p>Software will need to be written to analyse the type of purchases the user is making and determine what budget it will come out of e.g. groceries, petrol, food etc. There will also need to be software that takes this information and formats it in a graph for the user to see each month.</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge for me, is knowing where to start with actually developing an app like this. I will need a lot of collaboration with others with much more experience with app development, programming, and app design.</p>
<p>If this project is successful, many people may be able to discover the comfort of financial security. My aim for this app, is to help people stop living paycheck to paycheck in an easy, low effort way. Through the use of notifications, it may reduce the need for the user to actually go into the app, thus allowing them to spend less time worrying about the budget, and more time enjoying a chance at financial security.</p>
